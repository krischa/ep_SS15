\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{1.5.1}
It is well observable, that the peaks shrink when the $\SI{2.2}{\kilo\ohm}$ RC-link is build in (enlarged resolution at the osci-picture). The resistor damps the signal. It is also well observable that the pulses decrease exponential. This damping comes through reflexion at both ends of the cable.
