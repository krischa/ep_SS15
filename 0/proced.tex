\section{Procedure}
\subsection{0.4.1.a}
Different signals at different frequencies and amplitudes shall be observed at the oscilloscope.
\subsection{0.4.1.b}
$\Delta t$ of a rectangular voltage shall be determined by measuring the delay from $0.1U_0$ to $0.9U_0$ with the oscilloscope.\footnote{We must also pay attention to the bandwidth of the oscilloscope which is - so says the manual - $\SI{60}{\mega\hertz}$}
